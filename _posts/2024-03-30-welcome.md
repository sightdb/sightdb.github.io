We're excited to launch **SightDB** â€” a lightweight, CouchDB-compatible database built with Kazoo clusters in mind.

---

### ðŸ”§ What It Does

SightDB offers:

- Basic database and document CRUD
- Replication **from** CouchDB clusters
- Token and HTTP Basic Auth
- PostgreSQL under the hood

Weâ€™ve optimized it for **bare-metal VoIP deployments**, where simplicity and performance matter.

---

### ðŸš€ What's Next

Coming soon:

- CouchDB-compatible **views**
- Replication **to** CouchDB
- Admin UI or CLI helpers

Stay tuned and follow the [project repo](https://github.com/sightdb/sightdb) for updates.
